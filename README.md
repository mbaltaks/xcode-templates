xcode-templates
===============
Templates for Xcode. Install by pasting the following into Terminal:

```
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates
git clone https://github.com/mbaltaks/xcode-templates.git
```

Then restart Xcode. At that point, when you go to File -> New -> File, under iOS/Cocoa Touch, you should see 3 new options: Kiwi Spec file, OCUnit test case (iOS), and XCTest test case (iOS). You probably want the XCTest file.

Happy testing!

And for some hints on how to do testing well, try http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2009/08/24/writing-great-unit-tests-best-and-worst-practises/ and https://lizkeogh.com/2012/05/30/showcasing-the-language-of-bdd/.
